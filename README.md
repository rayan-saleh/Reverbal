<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Reverbal
Reverbal combines state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and a chatbot to deliver real-time feedback and suggestions on your conversations. Reverbal is able to listen to conversations and respond when appropriate without starting and stopping recordings. Think of reverbal as a conversation companion able to provide insights, respond to questions and act as semantic memory. Whilst there are several potential use-cases for this type of tool, we have provided (and will continue to build on) several use-cases below:

* Reverbal acting as a Customer Service Rep - answering technical support questions on a call
* Acting as a Counselor, exploring your emotions and thoughts out loud using socratic dialogue
* Acting as a conversation companion by providing interesting thoughts and topics of discussions as you speak
* A sports commentator - giving insights into statistics and facts about the sport
