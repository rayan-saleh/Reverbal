<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About Reverbal
Reverbal combines Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) via the Whisper API and an LLM via the chatGPT API to deliver real-time, continuous feedback and suggestions for your conversations. 

It is able to listen to your conversations and respond when appropriate without starting and stopping the recording. You can think of reverbal as a conversation companion that is able to provide insights, respond to questions and act as semantic memory. 

Whilst there are several potential use-cases for this type of tool, we have provided several example use-cases below:
* Reverbal acting as a Customer Service Rep - answering technical support questions on a call
* Acting as a Counselor/Therapist - exploring your emotions and thoughts out loud using socratic dialogue
* Acting as a Conversation Companion - providing interesting thoughts and topics of discussions as you speak
* A Sports Commentator - giving insights and facts about the game
